## üö® Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  
  CVEs (short for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) are standardized identifiers for publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
  The CVE system is overseen by the organization MITRE Corporation. The system is under the sponsorship of the U.S. government (specifically CISA).
  CVEs vary widely and some are critical (like remote code execution), others are low-risk.
  CVE IDs are unique identifiers assigned to specific vulnerabilities.
